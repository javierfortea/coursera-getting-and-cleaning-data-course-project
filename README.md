# Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

The code reads data from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and creates 2 files:
* File "result-UCI-HAR-data.csv": contains measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* File "averages-UCI-HAR-data.csv": contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To execute it:
source("run_analysis.R")
